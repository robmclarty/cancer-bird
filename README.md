# Cancer Bird

*A side-scrolling adventure game where you play as a cute blob of cancer cells and try to survive
by hopping from bird to bird, infecting them, and taking control of their brains. If you go 
too long without sucking on fresh, nutritious, bird-juices, you will wither and die.*

NOTE: This was all done in 2 days at [http://tojam.ca](http://tojam.ca), so that's why the code
might be a little messy. I just wanted to share it for learning purposes ;)

## Demo

## Usage

You'll need a copy of ImpactJS in order to build from source. This game was built against version 1.20.

The `impact` and `weltmeister` folder should go into the `lib` folder.

New levels can be built using Weltmeister.
